# subm_variance_spectra
Code and list of matchup images to compare spatial variance spectra between Landsat and MODIS Chl and SST imagery.

The folder /single_matchup/ and script single_matchup.m shows how I produced Figures 1 and 2 from the manuscript, and supplies the imagery data. 

The folder /all_matchups/ and script manuscript_figures.m shows how I produce Figures 3 and 4, and Table 3, from the manuscript, and supplies the spectra data. 

Matchup_image_list.csv, in /all_matchups/, has the list of Landsat and MODIS images I used in my study.
